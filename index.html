          <p>The Sonestown Covered Bridge is a Burr arch truss covered bridge over Muncy Creek in Davidson Township,
              Sullivan County, in the U.S. state of Pennsylvania. Built c. 1850, the bridge is 110 feet (34 m) long, and was
              placed on the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) in 1980. The bridge is named for the nearby
              unincorporated village of Sonestown; it was built to provide access to a gristmill, which operated until the
              early 20th century. The bridge construction is cruder than the other two surviving covered bridges in Sullivan
              County, with each Burr arch formed from six straight beams set at angles instead of a smooth curve. Despite
              being repaired or restored several times from 1969, as of 2016 the bridge was deemed "basically intolerable
              requiring high priority of corrective action" on the National Bridge Inventory. It is the shortest covered
              bridge in the county and as of 2015 had average daily traffic of 50 vehicles. (Full article...)
